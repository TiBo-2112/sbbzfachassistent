"""Learned average duration per pipeline stage, used to turn raw stage-
completion events into a calibrated ETA for the progress UI.

Calibrated per STAGE, not per document or per run, because stage cost scales
differently: LLM stages (deep_check_find/deep_check_missed) are chunked (see
app/pipeline/deep_check.py — typically just 1 chunk for an ordinary
document, more only for genuinely long ones), so their duration is tracked
per chunk and the estimate for a new run is simply per-chunk average * chunk
count; cheap, non-chunked stages (ingest, presidio_analyze, render, ...) are
tracked as one duration per stage-run. An exponential moving average lets
the estimate improve with repeated use (as the user asked for) without
needing to store a full history or being thrown off by one unusually
slow/fast outlier run.

"transcribe" (audio transcription — see app/pipeline/transcription.py) is
chunked too, but by second-of-audio rather than by document chunk, so what
gets stored under that key is a wall-clock-seconds-per-second-of-audio RATIO,
not a flat duration — deliberately distinct from the old approach of folding
a whole transcription into app.pipeline.pipeline.analyze_file()'s generic
single-unit "ingest" stage, which mixed near-instant text-document parsing
and multi-minute audio transcription into one shared (and therefore
text-biased-fast, badly wrong for audio) average.

The LM-Studio-backed stages (deep_check_find, deep_check_missed,
deep_check_locations, summarize, transcript_correction), plus "transcribe"
above, are actually stored under a per-model key (e.g.
"deep_check_find::qwen/qwen3.5-9b", "transcribe::small") — see
app/server.py's _calibration_key() — since a fast
and a slow model's real durations are wildly different and averaging them
together made estimates swing badly whenever the user switched models. This
module itself just stores whatever key it's given; the per-model
qualification decision lives in app/server.py, not here.
