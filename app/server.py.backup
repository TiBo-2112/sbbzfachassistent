"""FastAPI backend: serves the pywebview frontend and exposes the pipeline as
a local-only HTTP API. Pipeline exceptions are allowed to propagate up to the
route handlers here, which translate them into JSON error responses instead
of raw tracebacks or a crashed process.

Two-step flow: /api/analyze-* detects PII and returns categories for the user
to review, without redacting anything; /api/finalize takes the user's
category exclusions (and person-mode choice) and produces the final result.
The PendingState between the two calls holds Presidio's internal result
objects (not JSON-serializable in any useful way) and raw source text, so it
is kept server-side in `_pending`, keyed by an opaque per-analysis token —
never sent to or reconstructed from the client.

Background jobs + progress polling: analyze-file/analyze-clipboard/finalize
can run for minutes (Presidio, spaCy, and — with deep-check on — one or more
Ollama calls). Rather than blocking the HTTP request for all of that (leaving
the frontend with nothing to show but an indefinite spinner), each of these
three routes starts the actual pipeline call on a background thread and
returns a `job_id` immediately; the frontend polls GET /api/progress/{job_id}
(see `_Job`/`_jobs` below) for a stage label, percentage, and calibrated ETA
until `done` is true, at which point the same response's `result` field holds
exactly what the old synchronous response used to return in its body
(PendingAnalysis for analyze-*, PipelineResult for finalize) — so downstream
handling of that payload is unchanged, only how it's retrieved differs.
Errors from the pipeline call surface as the job's `error` field, not an
HTTP error status, since they're only known once the poll after they occur.

The pipeline calls (analyze/finalize/dependency-fix) are synchronous, CPU- and
IO-heavy code (Presidio, spaCy, Ollama HTTP calls, subprocess installs) — the
background-thread job runner above is this app's own mechanism for that, not
FastAPI's; route handlers that don't spawn a job (dependencies, settings,
replace-text) stay plain `def`s, not `async def`, so FastAPI's automatic
worker-thread dispatch for sync routes still protects the single asyncio
event loop from a slow one blocking any other request.

    Called both when a stage/chunk actually completes (from the on_progress/
    on_plan callbacks) AND on every /api/progress poll (see get_progress()) —
    the latter is what makes the bar/ETA keep moving smoothly WHILE a single
    long, non-chunked LLM call (e.g. summarize) is still in flight, by
    extrapolating from wall-clock time elapsed since that stage started
    rather than only updating at the (rare, coarse) checkpoints the pipeline
    itself reports. Without this, the display would freeze at whatever it
    showed at the start of any stage lasting longer than its estimate until
    that stage's single "done" event finally arrives.

    job.plan's per-stage unit counts are only an UPFRONT ESTIMATE — for the
    two chunked deep-check stages it's computed from a text (raw_text /
    state.raw_text) that isn't the same text actually chunked once Presidio
    (and, in finalize(), the first deep-check pass) has redacted it down to
    something shorter, so the true chunk count is usually lower. job.stage_total

    stage is currently running, so it's used here (instead of the plan's
    static estimate) for that one stage, in both the numerator and the
    denominator — without this, a stage whose real count undercuts the
    estimate would visibly stall near the end (waiting on estimated-but-
    nonexistent remaining chunks) and then jump once the next stage begins.
