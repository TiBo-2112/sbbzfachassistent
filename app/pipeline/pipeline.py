"""Pipeline orchestrator: ingest/transcription -> analyze -> (user reviews
categories) -> finalize (redact -> deep_check -> summarize -> render).

Two-step flow: `analyze_file`/`analyze_clipboard` (via `analyze`) detect PII
and return categories for the user to review, without redacting anything yet.
`finalize` takes the user's category exclusions (and person-mode choice —
redact/numbered/pseudonymize) and produces a `FinalizeOutput`. The PendingState in between is kept server-side
(see app.server's token cache) — it is not a pydantic model because it holds
Presidio's internal RecognizerResult objects and, for tabular source formats,
the original file bytes, none of which cross the HTTP boundary.

Deep-check's first LLM pass (`deep_check.find_candidates()`, called from
`analyze()`) is handed the RAW, unredacted text. It used to run against a
Presidio-redacted "preliminary" text instead, purely as an extra privacy
precaution — but the local LLM backend (LM Studio; see
app/llm/lmstudio_client.py's docstring for why it's guaranteed to be the
local, never-networked instance this reasoning depends on) is never reachable
over the network either way, and that precaution had two real, observed
costs and no compensating benefit: Presidio's own NER mistakes could corrupt
the very phrases the LLM needed to read intact (observed: a mis-tagged
LOCATION span ate part of an unrelated sentence that contained a nickname),
and pre-redacting collapsed every distinct person in the document to the
same generic "[PERSON]" placeholder, removing the LLM's ability to tell
WHICH person a nickname/role/context clue belonged to whenever a document
mentions more than one. See `app/pipeline/deep_check.py`'s module docstring
for how its prompts were adjusted to match (the model must now be told to
ignore the obvious direct identifiers it can plainly see, since Presidio
already handles those, and only report indirect/contextual ones).

`find_missed_pii()`/`find_missed_locations()` (run later, in `finalize()`)
and `summarize_text()` are NOT part of the above change and still only ever
see the true FINAL, fully-processed text (post category-exclusion, post
person-mode). That is not a privacy precaution to begin with, but a
correctness requirement independent of it: those two deep-check passes exist
specifically to audit the actual final output for anything left un-redacted,
and a summary of an "anonymized" document has to summarize the
actually-anonymized text — summarizing the original would defeat the
category exclusions/pseudonymization the user just chose.

`finalize()` also runs a second, later deep-check pass (`deep_check.
find_missed_pii()`) against the true final text, once category exclusions
and person-mode are already applied — a safety net for plain PII the
deterministic pass and the first LLM sweep both missed outright (stray
location names, names left in signature lines, business/reference numbers),
gated behind the same `deep_check` option. See `app/pipeline/deep_check.py`'s
module docstring for why this one needs `excluded_categories` itself rather
than filtering its output afterwards.

Progress reporting: `analyze()`/`analyze_file()`/`finalize()` all accept an
optional `on_progress(stage, current, total)` callback (fired once per stage
start/end, and once per chunk for the two deep-check stages — see
deep_check.py) and an optional `on_plan(stages)` callback. `on_plan` fires
exactly once, as the very first thing each function does, with the full
ordered `[(stage_name, expected_unit_count), ...]` list for the work it is
about to do — raw_text (and therefore chunk counts) is already fully known
at that point in both functions, so the caller (app.server, driving the
progress-bar UI) gets an accurate plan up front rather than having to
discover stages as they happen. `analyze_file()` reports its own "ingest"
stage (or, for audio input, delegates to `transcription.transcribe_audio()`'s
own "transcribe" stage — see that module's docstring) via on_progress before
calling analyze() (whose on_plan intentionally covers only the stages from
analyze() onward — ingest/transcribe precede it and aren't part of that
plan). Audio input has a third such phase in between: `transcript_correction.
correct_transcript()`'s own "transcript_correction" stage, reported the
identical way (it calls on_plan/on_progress itself, same as
transcribe_audio() does) — see that module's docstring for why this step
exists and runs unconditionally.
